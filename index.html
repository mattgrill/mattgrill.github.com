        <h2>Briefly About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>My parent's worst mistake was getting me a computer. My life was over; they never saw me again. I always wondered how things worked. I started with an old lawn mower engine in my grandparent's garage and quickly moved onto the VCR and eventually my computer. Once you realize that everything just plugs into something else you realize you want to make it do something different, solve a problem, or fix a bug. My first attempt at programming was a two-player tank shooter, complete with bullet physics, written in Microsoft Visual Basic. This is how I got into programming and I’ve never looked back.</p>

        <div class="content">

          <h3>Senior Developer and Content Management System Advisor at San Diego Gas & Electric / <a href="https://www.sdge.com">sdge.com</a> <br/><span class="date">January 2008 - Current</span></h3>
          <p>I’ve been with San Diego Gas & Electric since 2008. In that time we’ve launched three completely different versions of our site. A fourth iteration, a responsive HTML5 version, was launched in November of 2012.</p>
          <p>Starting in 2011 I led a team to build a new version of SDGE.com utilizing the content management system Drupal. This 11 month affair launched in November of 2011.</p>
          <p>Starting in January of 2012 we began work to completely reengineer our existing theme for Drupal to bring a responsive feel to our existing template. Responsive sites of this scale are still relatively rare and nonexistent in the public utility arena.</p>
          <p>This process was driven by our constant need to improve and innovate. Customer research and feedback was taken into account when designing the new theme and continues to be an effective tool.</p>
          <p>In my time with San Diego Gas & Electric I’ve worked with our other internal development teams to deploy a real-time outage map, anemometer dashboard, mobile specific version of our account and bill-pay systems, and highly available weekly energy consumption graph generator.</p>
          <p>Additional I have gained experience in server administration, deployment and maintenance. Our current stack includes Varnish, NGINX, Apache and PHP.</p>

          <h3  class="PR10">Developer / <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/">sdsc.edu</a> <br/><span class="date">December, 2007 - March, 2008</span></h3>
          <p>I developed a toolset to translate and render Protein Data Bank (PDB) using MEL script and Python. Once translated to a Maya compatible format the proteins were then rendered on an available supercomputer.</p>

          <h3>Developer / <a href="http://www.aquent.com/">aquent.com</a> <br/><span class="date">January 2004 - July 2007</span></h3>
          <p>I worked with a number of companies in San Diego including UCSD News, Mad Catz, San Diego Association of Realtors and Sempra Energy through Aquent, a top creative and technical staffing agency.</p>
